# Final Robot Perception Model

The model takes as input an image of objects that look very similar in a cluttered environment, and can take text instrcutions of an object and detect that object 
coordinates. 

Testing: How far are resulting coordinates with/without training from the actual coordinates referred to by the instructions

use:
change these parameters as desired:
```instruction```: The instruction for which block you are refering to in text
```img_path``` the path to the image location with multimodal_robotics as the root directory
